### Purpose

Create maps like the example shown below. 

* The title is the name of taxa being mapped

* Outlines of states in region being mapped

* Colored points correspond to legend for grouping variable

* The number of samples with the current taxa is displayed at the bottom

### Instructions

* Upload a file under "Load Data".  The status bar will tell you when the upload
is complete.  Then return to this screen.

    +	Required fields: SampleID, TaxaID, Count, Latitude, Longitude

    +	Optional field: grouping variable (for color-coding data points)

    +	Important note: Maps appear in the order in which the taxa occur in the 
    input file so be sure to sort as desired.

*	Define the map extent

    +	Type in the desired extent 

*	Click the ‘Run Function’ button; a status bar will appear in the lower right 
corner.

*	After the function is done running, the ‘Download Results’ button will be 
active. Click this button to retrieve your results.

*	Save the file in the desired folder. The maps will be in a PDF format.

### Warning!

The output files can be very large (the PDFs treat every data point as 
an individual graphic element). Consider limiting the number of taxa in your 
input files.
